## **Generative Art** is a process of algorithmically generating new ideas, forms, shapes, colors or patterns. 

-   You must first create rules that provide boundaries for the creation process. 

-   Then a computer follows those rules to produce new works on your behalf.  

-   Computers can generate thousands of ideas in milliseconds

## **Generative Art Example:**

**Georg Nees - Schotter (Gravel), 1968**

A row of 12 squared gradually increases magnitude of randomness in location and rotation.

-   Contrasting information in the title vs the legend. Is this info from 2017 & 2018? Or 2016 & 2017?

-   The data labels on the bars are horizontal - must rotate head to be able to read

-   Data labels are redundant if the Y axis has the dollar cut off information

-   Lastly, more contrasting colors could have been used (e.g a darker blue).
