All models have the same regression line equation 

All models are statistically significant 

However:

-   The top left model is the only figure where the observations are distributed evenly around the regression line 

-   The other models show that while the regression line is technically the best-fit, it does not accurately represent the data

This shows that regression results should always be combined with data visualization in order to get the full picture.

I changed the type of the plot characters to diamonds (pch =23).

Altered the colors of the plot characters to an outline of blue, filled with a purple.

I changed the line type to a dashed line (lty =2). The width was increased (lwd =3). The color was changed to red.
